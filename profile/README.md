# Blockcore

Blockcore is an open source project started by a group of blockchain developers and engineers to realize a fully integrated platform for building custom blockchains.

Blockcore is a platform that enables you to build your own blockchains, with software such as blockchain nodes, explorer, indexers, wallets for desktop, mobile and web, decentralized web node, tipbot, decentralized identifiers and more.

We are building a better future based on #Web5 and are very open for new community members. Let's go!
